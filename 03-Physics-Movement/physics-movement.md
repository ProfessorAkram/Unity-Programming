# Physics Movement
## Lesson Overview

This lesson explores how Unity’s physics engine drives object motion using Rigidbody components. You’ll learn how to move objects using both direct velocity control and applied forces to create realistic physical interactions.

## Tutorial Lessons

#### [01: Understanding Rigidbody Physics](rigidbody.md)
Learn how Rigidbody components enable gravity, collisions, and dynamic motion within Unity’s physics system.

#### [02: Moving Objects with Linear Velocity](velocity-movement.md)
Use Rigidbody velocity to control smooth, consistent motion ideal for player and object movement.

#### [03: Moving Objects with AddForce](force-movement.md)
Apply forces to create acceleration, jumping, or physics-based effects for more dynamic and realistic motion.
