# Unity UI Basics

The **User Interface (UI)** in Unity is a special layer that displays information and provides ways for the player to interact with your game. Common examples include health bars, score counters, buttons, and menus.

## Canvas

All UI elements in Unity live inside a **Canvas**, a GameObject that defines how the UI is drawn on screen.
