# Basic Movement in Unity 
When designing games, one of the most common tasks is moving an object from one place to another. For example, imagine you want a projectile, like a fireball, to travel across the screen from point A to point B. How can we make this happen in Unity?

The answer lies in one of the most important components every GameObject has: the **Transform** component.

## The Transform Component

Every GameObject in Unity automatically has a **Transform**. You can think of it as the object's "address" in the game world; it tells Unity where the object is, how it's rotated, and how large it is.

The Transform has three main properties:

- **Position** - where the object is located.  
- **Rotation** - the object's orientation (how it's turned).  
- **Scale** - the size of the object.  

## Understanding 3D Positions with Vector3

In Unity, every object‚Äôs position in 3D space is represented by a **Vector3**, which is a combination of three numbers: X, Y, and Z.

- **X** : Left and right
- **Y**: Up and down
- **Z** : Forward and backward
 
**Vector3** represents **direction** and **magnitude**. Positive and negative values on each axis determine **which way** and **how far** the object moves. 
 
### Vector3 Shorthand

Unity provides several built-in **Vector3** shortcuts that represent common directions:

| Vector3           | Meaning                    | Equivalent Vector |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| `Vector3.zero`   | Center of the scene          | (0, 0, 0)       |
| `Vector3.right`   | Move to the right          | (1, 0, 0)       |
| `Vector3.left`    | Move to the left           | (-1, 0, 0)      |
| `Vector3.up`      | Move up                    | (0, 1, 0)       |
| `Vector3.down`    | Move down                  | (0, -1, 0)      |
| `Vector3.forward` | Move forward in Z axis     | (0, 0, 1)       |
| `Vector3.back`    | Move backward in Z axis    | (0, 0, -1)      |

These shortcuts make it easier to write movement code without remembering the exact numbers for each axis.

>[!TIP]
> Using `Vector3` shortcuts like `Vector3.up` or `Vector3.right` makes your code more readable and reduces mistakes when specifying directions manually.

---
## Create the `MoveTransform` Class
Before we can get started moving GameObjects via code, we need to create a class that moves a GameObject by directly manipulating its **Transform** component.

It‚Äôs important to clearly recognize the purpose of the class in its name, following proper naming conventions. Since this class is responsible for moving objects using the Transform system, we will name it: **`MoveTransform`**

This name makes the purpose of the class explicit:

- It indicates that the class is a behavior attached to a GameObject.  
- It differentiates it from future movement classes, like `MoveRigidbody`, which will use physics.  

By choosing clear and descriptive names, we make our code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

### GameObject Componets
For a class to run in Unity, it must either be **attached to a GameObject** or be called from another class that is attached to a GameObject present in the scene at runtime.

When a class is attached to a GameObject, it is referred to as a **component**. Components allow GameObjects to have specific behaviors, such as movement, rendering, or collision detection.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before continuing, make sure the `MoveTransform` component has been added to a GameObject in your Unity scene.
> To do this, you have a few options:
> - Drag and drop the C# script from the **Project Window** onto the GameObject in the **Hierarchy Window** or the **Scene Window**.  
> - With the GameObject selected, drag and drop the script into the **Inspector Window**.  
> - Alternatively, in the **Inspector Window**, click the **Add Component** button, then type the name of the component (`MoveTransform`) and select it.  
> Once added, the script becomes a component of the GameObject, allowing it to control its behavior during gameplay.

<br>

---

## Setting Object's Transfom
GameObject's transform values can be set in the **Inspector Window** in the editor. More often than not, however, this transformation should be dynamic, through code. To do this, we need to reference the `transform` component and the property we want to manipulate, in this case `position`, followed by the value we want.

For example:
```csharp
transform.position = Vector3.zero;
```
Code Breakdown: 
- `transform` references the GameObject‚Äôs Transform component.  
- `position` is the property representing its current location.  
- `Vector3.zero` is shorthand for `(0, 0, 0)`, which sets its position to the center of the scene.

<br>

>[!NOTE]
> Notice how we don‚Äôt need to write `this.transform`. The script is attached to the GameObject, so Unity already knows we‚Äôre talking about *that object‚Äôs* transform.

<br>

---

## The Unity Lifecycle

To position a GameObject by script, the code needs to be placed inside one of Unity‚Äôs lifecycle methods. These are special methods Unity automatically calls at specific times during a GameObject‚Äôs existence.

Since this line directly sets the position once, it makes the most sense to place it in either `Awake()` or `Start()`. Both methods run once when the object is created, but there are subtle differences:

### üìå Awake vs. Start

#### Awake()
- Called immediately when the script instance is loaded.  
- Runs before any `Start()` methods.  
- Good for setting up values or references that don‚Äôt depend on other objects.  

#### Start()
- Called before the first frame update, but only if the script instance is enabled.  
- Runs after all `Awake()` methods have finished.  
- Good for initialization that depends on other objects being ready.

<br>

> [!Tip]
> - Use `Awake()` for setting up your own object‚Äôs internal values.  
> - Use `Start()` if your setup depends on other objects (for example, if you need to reference another GameObject that might not exist yet in `Awake()`).

<br>

Therefore, in this example, we would set our position in the `Awake()` method as in the example below: 

```csharp
private void Awake()
{
    //Set GameObject's initial position
    transform.position = Vector3.zero;
}//end Awake()

```
<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to always save your script before testing it in the Unity Editor.  
> Press **Play** in the Editor to see the script in action.

<br>
---
## Moving GameObjects with Transform

To move a GameObject, we can manipulate its **Transform** component at different points in the GameObject‚Äôs lifecycle. For example:

- During a triggered event, like a key press.  
- Every frame of the game, using the `Update()` method.  

Instead of simply setting the position (which would teleport the object), we often want to **increment it**, so the object moves smoothly over time. We do this by adding to the current position.

For example, to move an object 1 unit to the right every frame:

```csharp
private void Update()
{
   //Move GameObject to the right
   transform.position += Vector3.right; 
} // end Update()
```

### Understanding Frame Rate
While the example for moving a GameObject works, there‚Äôs a big problem: the **object‚Äôs speed depends on the frame rate**.  

**Frame rate** is the number of frames (images) displayed per second in a game or animation. It is measured in **FPS** (*Frames Per Second*).  

Right now, our movement code simply adds a direction vector (e.g., `Vector3.right ‚Üí (1, 0, 0)`) to the object‚Äôs position once per frame. That means:  

- At **60 FPS**, the object moves **60 units per second** (`1 unit each frame √ó 60 frames`).  
- At **120 FPS**, the object moves **120 units per second**.  

In other words, faster machines make the object move *twice as fast*, while slower machines make the movement feel *sluggish or unfair*.  

Frame rates can vary widely depending on hardware and performance, but most games target around **60 FPS** for smooth gameplay. 

To combat this issue, we need a method to make the object's movement **independent of the frame rate**. That‚Äôs where `Time` and `Time.deltaTime` come in.

### Using `Time.deltaTime`
Unity‚Äôs `Time` class keeps track of several aspects of game time, such as:

- `Time.time` ‚Üí the total time since the game started  
- `Time.deltaTime` ‚Üí the time elapsed since the last frame

  <br>

The word **delta (Œî)** is a mathematical symbol meaning *‚Äúchange in‚Äù*.  
In this case, `deltaTime` is the change in time between frames, calculated as:

```math
Œît = t_current frame - t_last frame
``` 
<br>

Let's say that the game is running at 60 FPS, therefore each frame lasts about 1/60th of a second, so:

``` math
Time.deltaTime = 1 / 60 ‚âà 0.016 (seconds-per-frame)
```
<br>

>[!NOTE]
> Unity handles this calculation automatically. You don‚Äôt need to worry whether the game is running at 30 FPS, 60 FPS, or any other frame rate; `Time.deltaTime` always gives you the correct value.

### Adding Speed
In the example above, if `Time.deltaTime` returns a value like `0.016`, which, when multiplied by a direction vector (like `Vector3.right`) would move the object just `0.016` units per frame, far too small to be meaningful in gameplay.  

What‚Äôs missing is **speed**, a variable that defines how fast the object should move, measured in *units per second*.  

By multiplying **speed √ó deltaTime √ó direction**, we calculate the actual distance the object should move **this frame**, making the movement **smooth**, **consistent**, and **meaningful** regardless of frame rate.



```csharp
private float _speed = 5f; // units per second

private void Update()
{
    //Move GameObject to the right
    transform.position += _speed * Time.deltaTime * Vector3.right;
}//end Update()

```
Let‚Äôs break this down:

- `_speed` defines how far the object should move per second.  
- `Time.deltaTime` scales that movement for the actual time elapsed since the last frame, keeping motion consistent across different frame rates.  
- `Vector3.right` specifies the direction of movement.  

This approach ensures that the object moves **smoothly**, **consistently**, and **efficiently**, even on machines with different frame rates.

<br>

>[!NOTE]
>Notice that the direction vector appears at the end. This is deliberate: by **multiplying the two floats first** (`_speed * Time.deltaTime`), Unity performs **fewer vector multiplications**, which is slightly **more efficient** and avoids creating unnecessary temporary `Vector3` objects.

<br>

---

## Private Fields and `[SerializeField]`

In object-oriented programming, it‚Äôs best practice to keep class fields **private**. This ensures **encapsulation**, meaning that the internal state of an object is protected from unintended external changes.

```csharp
private float _speed = 5f; // Good practice: keep fields private
```

In Unity, **public fields** are automatically displayed in the Inspector, which makes it convenient to adjust values without touching the code. This is especially useful when:

- You want to tweak values in the Editor for testing or balancing.  
- You are working on a team, and a designer or level designer needs access to adjust variables like speed, jump height, or health.

```csharp
public float _speed = 5f; // Automatically shown in Inspector, but breaks encapsulation

```
The problem is that making a variable public just for Inspector access breaks **encapsulation**, other scripts can now freely change it.

To solve this, Unity provides **attributes** special markers, in square brackets `[]` that are placed above variables to change how they behave in the Inspector. One of the most useful is `[SerializeField]`. This attribute lets you keep a field private in code while still exposing it in the Inspector for easy editing:

```csharp
[SerializeField]
private float _speed = 5f; // Private field, but editable in Inspector
```

- The field remains private, so other scripts cannot access it directly.  
- Unity serializes it and displays it in the Inspector, allowing you to tweak it visually.
  - **Serialization** allows Unity to store the value between editor sessions and scene loads.

Even though the field is private in code, Unity can still read and write its value in the Editor.  

This is the recommended approach for variables you want to **expose to the editor** but **keep encapsulated in code**.

 `[SerializeField]` gives you the best of both worlds: proper encapsulation in code, and convenient editing in the Unity Inspector.


--- 

## Moving in Different Directions

So far, our object moves only to the right using `Vector3.right`. But what if we want it to move in another direction, or the level designer wants to control the direction **without modifying the code**?

Just as we created a field for **speed**, we can also create a field for **direction**:

```csharp
[SerializeField]
private float _speed = 5f; // Private field, but editable in Inspector

[SerializeField]
private Vector3 _direction = Vector3.right; // Default direction is right


private void Awake()
{
    //Set GameObject's inital position
    transform.position = Vector3.zero;
}//end Awake()

private void Update()
{
   //Move GameObject
   transform.position += _speed * Time.deltaTime * _direction ; 
}//end Update()

```
Now the designer can change the movement direction in the Inspector, for example, up, forward, or any custom vector, without touching the code.

This makes the movement **flexible and data-driven**, which is a core principle of good game design: allow designers to tweak behavior **without modifying scripts**.

---

## Optimizing Movment: Streamlining `Update()`

Right now, all of the functionality for moving the GameObject happens directly inside the `Update()` method.

```csharp

private void Update()
{
    //Move GameObject
    transform.position += _speed * Time.deltaTime * _direction;  
}//end Update()

```

While this works, placing all logic in `Update()` can make it **cluttered**, **harder to manage**, and **less efficient**. Streamlining `Update()` by delegating tasks to dedicated methods helps **optimize performance**, **reduce errors**, and make your **code easier to read** and maintain. Here‚Äôs why this matters:

### Potential for Errors
- `Update()` runs every frame, so any logic inside it executes constantly.  
- If multiple actions are added here, it‚Äôs easy to introduce bugs or unintended behavior.

### Reusability (DRY Principle)
- If we need the same movement logic in other places (e.g., triggered by an event or another script), duplicating code in multiple `Update()` methods violates the **Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle.  
- By creating a separate method, we can reuse the same movement logic whenever it‚Äôs needed.

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each method should have **one responsibility**.  
- If `Update()` both moves the object and handles other logic (like animations, collisions, or input), it breaks this principle.

--- 

## Creating a `Move()` Method

To address the issues with placing all logic in `Update()`, we can move the movement logic into a dedicated method, like `Move()` and call the method from the `Update()`. This allows us to:

- Keep `Update()` clean and focused.  
- Trigger movement from other events or scripts without duplicating code.  
- Maintain a single responsibility for each method.

```csharp
private void Update()
{
    Move();
}//end Update()

///<summary>
/// Move the object by the transform position
///</summary>
private void Move()
{
    //Move GameObject
    transform.position += _speed * Time.deltaTime * _direction;

}//end Move()

```

---

# üéâ New Achievement: Basic Movement

We‚Äôve now created a **MoveTransform component** that moves our GameObject on the screen! 
```csharp
public class MoveTransform : MonoBehaviour
{
     [SerializeField]
     private float _speed = 5f; // Private field, but editable in Inspector
     
     [SerializeField]
     private Vector3 _direction = Vector3.right; // Default direction is right
     
     
     private void Awake()
     {
         //Set GameObject's inital position
         transform.position = Vector3.zero;
     }//end Awake()
     
     private void Update()
     {
         Move();
     }//end Update()
     
     ///<summary>
     /// Move the object by the transform position
     ///</summary>
     private void Move()
     {
         //Move GameObject
         transform.position += _speed * Time.deltaTime * _direction;
     
     }//end Move()

}//end class
```
This component can be attached to **any GameObject**, and it works the same way while still allowing us to **control the speed and direction** of each object individually.

But wait‚Ä¶ what if we wanted more control over how our object moves? Consider these possibilities:
- What if we wanted to safely change speed or direction from another script?
- What if we wanted to cap the object‚Äôs maximum speed?
- What if we didn‚Äôt want the object to move immediately on game start?
- What if we wanted to stop or resume movement dynamically?
- What if we wanted to override speed or direction for a single move call?

These questions highlight ways we can extend the capabilities of our Move component. Next, we‚Äôll refactor our class to implement these features, making it more flexible, modular, and easier to control during gameplay.

--- 

# Refactoring `MoveTransform`
Almost **all code benefits from refactoring** at some point, whether to improve readability, maintainability, or flexibility. By revisiting our MoveTransform component, we can make it **cleaner**, **more modular**, and capable of handling a wider range of scenarios without changing its core behavior.

In the case of our `MoveTransform` component we address the features mentioned above. 

## Create Properties for Speed and Direction
Currently, our MoveTransform component stores data (variables) directly. In programming, this is known as a **field**.
```csharp
private float _speed = 5f;
private Vector3 _direction = Vector3.right;
```
These fields are marked **private**, which means other scripts **cannot directly access or override them**. This is good practice for **encapsulation**, but it also limits flexibility when we want to safely read or modify these values from other scripts.

To solve this, we use **properties**, special methods that behave like fields but allow us to **control reading**, **writing**, and **validation**.

Let‚Äôs **add these properties** to our class so that we can safely access and modify the speed and direction of our MoveTransform component without exposing the underlying fields:

```csharp
public float Speed { get; set; }
public Vector3 Direction { get; set; }
```
By adding these **properties**, other parts of our game can interact with the `MoveTransform` component **safely and dynamically**.

For example:

- The UI could read the current `Speed` and `Direction` to display them on-screen.  
- A boundary system could reverse the `Direction` when the object hits a wall.  
- A power-up could temporarily double the `Speed` without directly modifying the private field.  

Using properties in this way keeps our code **encapsulated**, **flexible**, and **easier to maintain**, while still allowing other systems to interact with the object in meaningful ways.

---
## Add Validation for Speed (Capping)

Once we have a **public property** for speed, we may want to **prevent invalid or excessively high values** that could break gameplay or feel unbalanced. For example, we might want to make sure the speed is never negative or higher than a certain maximum.

### Create a Maximum Speed Field

First we will need a variable to define the **maximum allowed speed**. This should be a **private field** but **serialized** so we can adjust it in the Inspector:

```csharp
[SerializeField] 
private float _maxSpeed = 10f; // Max speed set in the Inspector
```
<br>

>[!NOTE]
> We don‚Äôt need a property for `_maxSpeed` because it's only used internally for validation. Other scripts don‚Äôt need to read or write it directly.

<br>

### Create Validation Method

Now that we have `_maxSpeed` we can create a method to **validate or cap** speed whenever it‚Äôs set.
In this instance, we want to make sure the speed stays within a valid range; **never below 0 and never above _maxSpeed**.
One method of doing this would to be to manually check the values: 
```chsarp
// ‚ùå Less Efficient
if (Speed < 0f) Speed = 0f;
else if (Speed > _maxSpeed) Speed = _maxSpeed;
```
While manually checking values works, there‚Äôs a more concise and efficient way to enforce a value within a range using Unity‚Äôs built-in `Mathf.Clamp()` method.

`Mathf.Clamp()` limits a value to a specific range using three parameters:

1. The value to limit.  
2. The minimum allowed value.  
3. The maximum allowed value.  

In this case, we can use it to ensure our speed stays between `0` and `_maxSpeed`:

```cshapr
 // ‚úÖ More Efficient
 return Mathf.Clamp(speed, 0f, _maxSpeed);
```
This single line replaces multiple `if` statements while keeping the code clean and readable.

Now that we understand how to cap the speed, we can create a private method called `ValidateSpeed()` that will handle this.

- It‚Äôs **private** because it is only used internally by the `MoveTransform` class and doesn‚Äôt need to be accessed from other scripts.  
- It returns a `float`, which is the validated speed after applying the range check.  
- Whenever we set the `Speed` property, the new value is passed through this method to ensure it stays within the allowed range.

```csharp
private float ValidateSpeed(float speed)
{
    //Clamp Speed between 0 and maximum speed
    return Mathf.Clamp(speed, 0f, _maxSpeed);

}//end ValidateSpeed()
```
#### How it works

1. A new speed value is assigned to the `Speed` property.  
2. The property setter calls `ValidateSpeed()` and passes the value to it.  
3. `ValidateSpeed()` returns the clamped value, ensuring it is never less than `0` or greater than `_maxSpeed`.  
4. The returned value is then stored in the private `_speed` field.  

By using this approach, any assignment to `Speed` automatically validates the value, keeping the movement logic **safe** and **predictable**.

### Updating the Speed Property to Include Validation
Now that we have our `ValidateSpeed()` method, we need to **update the `Speed` property** so that any time a new value is assigned, it automatically goes through the validation process.

```csharp
public float Speed
{
    get => _speed;

    //Validate speed when set
    set => _speed = ValidateSpeed(value); 
}
```
### Validating Speed Field
Currently, our speed validation only applies when the **property** is set. However, in the Editor, we are modifying the **field** directly. What if we want to ensure that a level designer sets the initial speed within a valid range?

One approach is to call `ValidateSpeed()` once when the component initializes, ensuring that any value set in the Inspector gets clamped correctly:

```csharp
// ‚òëÔ∏è Works, but less obvious to the designer

     private void Awake()
     {
         //Set GameObject's inital position
         transform.position = Vector3.zero;

        //Validate initial speed
        _speed ValdiateSpeed(_speed);

     }//end Awake()

```
While this works, it‚Äôs **less apparent** to a designer working in the Inspector what values are allowed.

A more designer-friendly approach is to **limit the input directly in the Inspector** using Unity‚Äôs `[Range(min, max)]` attribute. This shows a slider for the field, making it immediately clear what values are valid. Using `[Range]`, runtime validation is only necessary if the value changes dynamically:

```csharp
 // ‚úÖ Easier to understand
     [SerializeField, Range(0f, 10f)]
     private float _speed = 5f;

....

 // ‚úÖ Levae Awake as it was before
     private void Awake()
     {
         //Set GameObject's inital position
         transform.position = Vector3.zero;

     }//end Awake()
```

This approach improves clarity, prevents invalid input, and helps designers understand the constraints set by the script.

---
## Adding Movement Control Flags
In many games, we don‚Äôt always want an object to start moving immediately or move continuously without restriction. For example:

- An enemy might wait before chasing the player.
- A moving platform might start only when a button is pressed.
- A power-up might temporarily freeze player movement.

To manage these situations, we can introduce **control flags** , which are simple **Boolean variables** that act as switches to turn certain behaviors **on or off**.

In our `MoveTransform` component, we will add two flags:

- `canMove` ‚Üí Determines whether the object is allowed to move at all.

- `moveOnWake` ‚Üí Determines whether the object starts moving automatically when initialized.


Add Movement Control Flags

Introduce a canMove flag to test whether the object should move each frame.

Add a moveOnWake flag to control whether movement starts automatically when the object is initialized.

This sets up dynamic start/stop control.

[SerializeField] private bool canMove = true;
[SerializeField] private bool moveOnWake = true;

---

Update Move() to Accept Parameters

Refactor Move() to optionally accept speed and direction as parameters, falling back to the property values if none are provided.

This makes movement flexible and reusable from other scripts or events.



### Public or Private?
In our example, the `Move()` method is **private**, enforcing encapsulation. Deciding whether a method should be public or private can be tricky, so here are some guiding questions to consider:

- Does any external class truly need to call this method directly?  
- Would exposing this method create unnecessary dependencies between objects?  
- Could the behavior be triggered in a safer or more modular way, such as through events, signals, or internal condition checks?  

### Example

Imagine a player pulls a lever that causes platforms to move. Does the lever need direct access to the platform‚Äôs `Move()` method? Not necessarily. Instead:

- The platform could listen for an event triggered by the lever.  
- Or it could check conditions internally before moving.  

By keeping the method private, we avoid creating tight dependencies between unrelated objects, making the system easier to maintain and less error-prone.

> [!Tip]
> Use **private methods** to keep behavior self-contained, and carefully consider external access to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

### Dynamic Inputs
While we usually keep the `Move()` method **private** to encapsulate behavior, there are times when we want the same movement logic to work with dynamic inputs‚Äîfor example, applying a speed boost or changing direction.

In such cases, we can make the method **public** and allow other scripts to pass parameters. This approach lets us:

- **Reuse logic without duplication** ‚Äì no need to write separate movement code for each object.  
- **Control behavior dynamically** ‚Äì adjust speed, direction, or other movement properties on the fly.  
- **Maintain modular design** ‚Äì the object still controls how it moves, but external scripts can influence it safely through parameters.

---
## Dynamic Movement Using Parameters

In the instance of making our method **public**, we might also want to extend its capabilities so that it can handle dynamic inputs‚Äîfor example, changing speed, direction, or other movement properties at runtime. 

This allows multiple objects or events to use the same movement logic without directly accessing internal fields or properties, keeping the design **modular** and **reusable**.

To do this we can modify the original private `Move()` method to accept **direction** and speed as **parameters**:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Moves the object in a specified direction at a specified speed.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="direction">The direction to move the object.</param>
/// <param name="speed">The speed at which the object should move.</param>
private void Move(Vector3 direction, float speed)
{
   //Set Properites
   Direction = direction;
   Speed = speed

  //Move GameObject 
  transform.position += Direction * Speed * Time.deltaTime; 
}

```
**Code Breakdown**
The `<param>` comments document each parameter, making it clear to anyone reading the code what values the method expects:

- **direction** ‚Äì lets external scripts specify which way the object moves.  
- **speed** ‚Äì lets external scripts adjust the object‚Äôs movement speed.  

Since the parameters provide temporary input to the method, we now assign these values to the corresponding properties. This is important because:

- It ensures any validation logic in the property setter is applied automatically.  
- It updates the object‚Äôs internal state, so future movement calls reflect the new direction or speed.  
- It keeps the class consistent, letting the object ‚Äúremember‚Äù the most recent movement values rather than only using temporary variables.

### Handling Default Values

While the above works, there‚Äôs a downside: every time we call `Move()`, we **must provide both parameters**, even if we want the default behavior.

- If we only care about the object‚Äôs current **Direction** or **Speed**, passing parameters becomes repetitive.

- This adds unnecessary steps and goes against the **KISS principle** (‚ÄúKeep It Simple, Stupid‚Äù).

To solve this, we can allow the parameters to be **nullable** (`Vector3?` and `float?`) and fall back to the object‚Äôs properties if no value is provide. In this instance, we need a **local method variable** to store the actual values being used, either the passed paramter or fall back default value. 

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Moves the object in a specified direction at a specified speed.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="direction">The direction to move the object.</param>
/// <param name="speed">The speed at which the object should move.</param>
private void Move(Vector3? direction = null, float? speed = null)
{
   //Set local values
   moveDirection = direction ?? Direction;
   moveSpeed = speed ?? Speed;

  //Move GameObject 
  transform.position += moveDirection * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime; 
}

```
**Code Breakdown**

**1. Nullable Parameters (`Vector3?` and `float?`)**

  - The `?` after the type allows the parameter to be **nullable**, meaning it can hold a `null` value.  
  - If the caller doesn‚Äôt provide a value, `direction` or `speed` will be `null`.  
  - Using the `??` **null-coalescing operator**, which checks if the value on the left-hand side is null.
     - If it is not null, the left-hand value is used.
     - If it is null, the right-hand value is used as a fallback.

**2. Local Variables**
Since we have check for null paramters we need be able to store the resulting value, 
These local variables store the **resolved values** that the method will use for this frame.  

- They ensure clarity, readability, and consistency when calculating the movement.

**3.  Naming the Local Variables**

  - **moveDirection** ‚Äì clearly indicates the direction applied this frame.  
  - **moveSpeed** ‚Äì clearly indicates the speed applied this frame.  

This naming distinguishes temporary, per-call values from the object‚Äôs persistent properties.

**4. Updating the Movement Calculation**

 - Uses the resolved local variables for **frame-rate independent movement**.

## Extending functionality
## Adding Higher-Level Control

So far, we‚Äôve given our `Move()` method flexibility by allowing parameters for speed and direction, along with sensible fallbacks to default values. This gives programmers more dynamic control at runtime.

But what about control at a higher level? Imagine situations where we don‚Äôt want the object to move at all‚Äîregardless of speed or direction. For example:

- A player might be frozen by a trap or spell.  
- An NPC could be paused during a cutscene.  
- A platform might be inactive until the player triggers it.  

In these cases, passing parameters isn‚Äôt enough. We need a way to enable or disable motion entirely‚Äîsomething that gives level designers and game systems a simple ‚Äúon/off switch‚Äù for movement.

## Why Not Just Set Values to Zero?

It‚Äôs important to note that simply setting the values (like speed or direction) to zero isn‚Äôt an optimal solution.  

Right now, our `Move()` method is being called in `Update()`, so even if the object isn‚Äôt moving, the method is still **wasting processing time every frame**.  

Instead, we want a true **movement gatekeeper** that prevents unnecessary calculations altogether when motion is disabled.
