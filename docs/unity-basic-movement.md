## Basic Movement in Unity 
When designing games, one of the most common tasks is moving an object from one place to another. For example, imagine you want a projectile, like a fireball, to travel across the screen from point A to point B. How can we make this happen in Unity?

The answer lies in one of the most important components every GameObject has: the **Transform** component.

## The Transform Component

Every GameObject in Unity automatically has a **Transform**. You can think of it as the object's "address" in the game world, it tells Unity where the object is, how it'â€™'s rotated, and how large it is.

The Transform has three main properties:

- **Position** - where the object is located.  
- **Rotation** - the object's orientation (how it's turned).  
- **Scale** - the size of the object.  

In a 3D Unity project, the position is represented by an **(X, Y, Z)** vector:

- **X** - Left and right  
- **Y** - Up and down  
- **Z** - Forward and backward  

For example:
```csharp
transform.position += Vector3.right;
```
