# Transform Movement
## Lesson Overview

This lesson covers how to move objects in Unity using the Transform component. You’ll learn about position vectors, basic transform-based movement, refactoring update logic for cleaner design, and creating simple in-editor tests for debugging movement.

## Tutorial Lessons

#### [01: Understanding the Transform Component](transform-component.md)
Explore how the Transform component stores position, rotation, and scale, and how vectors represent an object’s position in 3D space.

#### [02: Basic Movement with `transform.position`](basic-movement.md)
Learn to move objects smoothly by updating their position using direction vectors and `Time.deltaTime`.

#### [03: Refactoring Movement Logic](refactor-movement.md)
Improve your movement script by moving logic out of `Update()` into its own method, adding flags and checks for better control and readability.

#### [04: Creating In-Editor Debug Tests](editor-only-debugging.md)
Build simple tools and test scripts within the Unity Editor to visualize and debug movement behavior efficiently.
