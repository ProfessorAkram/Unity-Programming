# Unity Game Development Lessons

This series of lessons is an introduction to Unity programming from a **modular, component-based perspective**. Instead of building full games from start to finish, youâ€™ll focus on developing **individual components**, each responsible for a specific behavior or feature. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have a collection of modular scripts and systems that can be combined to form complete, functional gameplay experiences.

Each lesson focuses on a key area of Unity development, introducing the underlying concepts, essential components, and hands-on tutorials to reinforce learning through practice.

## ðŸ“˜ Lesson Contents

### [1. Transform Movement](02-Tansform-Movement/transform-movement.md)
Master object motion at its most fundamental level. Learn how to control position using the Transform component, apply frame-rate independent movement, refactor your scripts for clarity, and use in-editor tests to visualize behavior.

### 2. [Physics Movement](03-Physics/Movement/physics-movement.md)
Bring your scenes to life with realistic motion. Explore Unityâ€™s physics engine, harness Rigidbody components, and experiment with velocity and forces to simulate weight, momentum, and dynamic interactions.

---

### 3. [Input Controllers](04-Input-Controllers/input-controllers.md)
Make your games responsive and interactive. Build action maps with Unityâ€™s New Input System, create a smooth player controller, and reuse the same framework for vehicles and other gameplay types.

### 4. [Colliders, Collisions, and Triggers](05-Physics-Interactions/physics-interfactions.md)
Turn contact into interaction. Discover how Unity detects collisions between objects, how to trigger events, and how to use these systems to build mechanics like pickups, hazards, and environmental effects.

### 5. [Lights, Cameras, and Audio](06-Lights-Cameras-Audio/lights-camera-audio.md)
Shape the playerâ€™s experience through sight and sound. Adjust lighting for mood, position cameras for focus and storytelling, and layer audio for depth and immersion.

### 6. [Unity UI (uGUI)](07-UI-Basics/unity-uGUI.md)
Design interfaces players can see and touch. Use the Canvas system to create menus, HUDs, and buttons, and connect them to scripts for seamless player interaction and feedback.
